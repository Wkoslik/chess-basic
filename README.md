# Basic Chess (Stretch Task)

## Overview
Coding out a full chess game is a pretty difficult task, but building out the base of one is a great way to hone your DOM manipulation abilities.

With this being additional work, try to look for ways you can use DOM manipulation to your advantage in creating a base position for a chess game.

This is also a chance to look at planning out a project prior to starting to code. Set aside a decent amount of time to think about what you will need to do and to think about potential pitfalls.

## Task
-   Create a chess board (8 x 8), with files and ranks being lettered and numbered accordingly (Google if you are unsure)
-   Place pieces on either side of the board, with pieces being white or black based on player side

Don't worry about assets/images, this is purely to get you thinking about creating elements in the DOM on a larger scale and also how you handle the logic involved. As long as you mark each square with it's rank & file + whatever piece is in it will work e.g Q for Queen, K for King

## Helpers
-   Don't write HTML directly into index.html
-   Don't worry about styling, as long as it's not a complete mess!
-   For pieces, it may be an idea to look at constructor functions and/or classes. We'll cover this next week for Canvas Crawler and you may have come across them in your game but it's a good intro/refresher
